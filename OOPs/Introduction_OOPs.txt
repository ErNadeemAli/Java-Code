OOPs Concepts
-------------
1) Encapsulation
2) Inheritance
3) Polymorphism
4) Abstraction

As we know java is an object oriented programming language program that will be developed using java will be object oriented program.
every object oriented program creates one or more then one objects during execution. Methods called by program will be executed on these objects.

what is an object?
------------------
Every real world entity is an object
Every object has following two characteristics

1) Attribute
2) Behaviour

Our program will create object as data container like variable and array.
It means our program can create variable, array as well as object to keep data in memory.

Variable Vs object
==================
Variable can hold only one value. It means your program can keep only one value in variable.
object can hold multiple values. These values will be States of real world  entity.
Variable can not be shared among Methods
Variable can be shared among methods

Creating object
================
As we know object oriented program creates one or more than objects during execution. program will create these objects from a class 
This is because every object is an instance of a class

What is Class?
==============
It is blueprint or template from which objects are created
Properties of the objects are defined inside class

public class Point{

    private int x;
    private int y;

    public Point(int a,int b){  //cunstroctur
        this.x=a;
        this.y=b;
    }
}

Define following inside class
1) Instance variables: It will hold data
2) Construcotrs: It will be responsible to assign data first time
3) Getters and Setters: These are methods and responsible to return data from the object and change data.

Instance variable
=================
Those variable that are declared/defined inside class without using static keyword are known as instance variables 
These variable will be attributes of object and hold states of object. Since object is an instance of the class that's why these variable are known as instance variable.

public class Product
{
    //declaring instance variable
    private int pid;
    private String name;
    private String brand;
    private int price;
}

These commands (command to create instance variable) are executed each time object from that class will be created by any program.
