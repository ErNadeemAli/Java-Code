Array
------
Your Program can create variable in memory to keep data.
Your Program can create Object in memory to keep data.
Your Program can create Array in memory to keep data.
Your Program can create LinkList in memory to keep data.

Data Structure
---------------
Data Structure is used to arrange Data in memory in proper manner so that time compelexity and space compelexity can be best not worst.

    Stack (LIFO)
    Quque (FIFO)
    Tree (Array or LinkList)
    Graph 

Memory Allocation of the Array is static and memory Allocation of LinkList is dynamic

static Memory -: Memory Allocation create  once during the program.

Array size will be fixed.
LinkList size will be dynamic.


When to create Array ?
======================
Program wants to keep similar type of multiple values/data in memory then program can create Array. It use contigous memory Allocation.
Data that will be kept into array is called element.
Element will be Allocated in contiguous manner to the array.
Due to this accessing element form the  array  is quite fast.

Declaring Array
===============
Write following command to declare Array

datatype[] name = new datatype[Size];
Let us suppose Your program wants to keep 10 int type value in memory then array command should be as follows

int[] arr=new int[10];

"int[] arr" will create variable arr.
"new int[10]" will create array of size 10 and type int and reference of the array will ve returned.
= operator will assign that reference of the variable arr.
0 will be assigned to each index. this will be default value of array.
