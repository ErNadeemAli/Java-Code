What is Compilation?
--------------------

It is a process in which source code i n converted into executable code. This will be done by Compiler

Following two activities are performed during Compilation
1) Parsing : Errors will  be checked inside source code and Errors will be shown 
2) Translation : if source code has no Errors then source code will be translated into machine understandable code.
