What is variable?
-----------------
program keeps data(input as well as output) in memory
program  reserves name space in memory to keep data
Java runtime enviroment allocates space to the program on demand. data kept into this space can be change by program anytime. That's why this space is known as variable.

So variable is named space in memory. program keeps data into variable. It means variable is container of data in memory.

command to create variable
---------------------------

datatype_of_variable name_of _variable;
int num;

Here int is datatype of variable
num is name of variable

Datatype are divided into following two categories

1) Primitive Datatypes
2) Non-Primitive Datatypes

Primitive Datatypes :-
---------------------
These are the system defined datatypes. In Java there are 8 Primitive Datatypes

1) byte   --> for integer type variable -> 8 bit
2) short  --> for integer type variable -> 16 bit
3) int    --> for integer type variable -> 32 bit
4) long   --> for integer type variable -> 64 bit

range of datatype
--------------------
byte -> -2^7 to 2^7-1
short -> -2^15 to 2^15-1
int -> -2^31 to 2^31-1
long -> -2^63 to 2^63-1

5) float    --> for decimal type variable -> 32 bit
6) double  --> for decimal type variable -> 64 bit

7) boolean  --> for boolean type variable -> 1 bit

8) char  --> for character type variable -> 16 bit

Assigining value to the variable
--------------------------------
write following command to assign value to the variable 

variable_name=value;

Rule:- Type of valid must be same as type of variable

value                  Type
342                    int
324L                   long
34.49                  double
34.39F                 float
'k'                    char
'*'                    char
'8'                    char
true                   boolean
flase                  boolean
"Hello"                string
