Operators :-
------------
We will have to write following commands also

1) command to perform arithmetic operation such as 
increment,decrement, addition, subtraction, etc
2) command to comparsion arithmetic operation
etc

Operators are used to define these commands
few operators are as follows
+,-,*,%,<,<=,>,>=,!=,==,+=,-=,*=,%=,&&,||,^,++,--,!,etc
we can divide these operators into following two categories
1) Unary operators --> ++ ,--,!
2) Binary operators --> rest operators are Binary operators

Note:- Every operator returns a value after performing operation.

Unary Operators
---------------
These operators are applied on single operand(data)
++(increment)
--(decrement)
!(not)

++(increment)
-------------
It is used to increase value of the variable by 1

int x=0;   //statement
write command to increase value of variable x by 1
following these  commands are possible
x=x+1;
or
x+=1;
or
x++;

--(decrement)
-------------
It is used to decrement value of the variable by 1

int x=0;   //statement
write command to decrement value of variable x by 1
following these  commands are possible
x=x-1;
or
x-=1;
or
x--;
